# Overview

{This is a very basic Weather Forecast app that I wrote in Java. The purpose of this program was to familiarize myself with the Java language, and to practice good programming habits.}

{This program uses a free weather API to get a simple forecast for the current day and display it to the user. This is done through inputting longitude and latitude coordinates.}

{Of course, I usually have access to the internet and web services with their own weather apps, but this is a fun alternative to using those. I wrote this app for functionality as much as for fun and learning. The basic idea of this app was to help teach myself how Java works, but it also retains a practical core function.}

{Here is a link to the software:}

# Development Environment

{I used OpenJDk and IntelliJ to write this program.}

{This was written in Java with OpenJDK, and I used a library to parse JSON files: JSONJAVA.}

# Future Work

{I have a good base functionality, but here are some features I could add in the future}

- Saving specific coordinates for easy access
- Saving weather data for viewing
- Displaying longer (more detailed) forecasts
